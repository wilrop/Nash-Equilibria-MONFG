# Nash Equilibria in Multi-Objective Normal-Form Games
This repository contains an algorithm for calculating the set of pure strategy Nash equilibria in any MONFG with an arbitrary player distribution given quasiconvex utility functions.

We aim to add more algorithms to this repository over time as research into this area continues.

## Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria
We currently have one algorithm for finding all PSNE in a given MONFG when assuming only quasiconvex utility functions.
Due to the theorems shown in PAPER LINK, these PSNE must necessarily represent all PSNE in the MONFG under ESR, SER and any blended setting.

## Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibria
In the future we plan on also contributing algorithms to this repo that are able to find a sample or all of the Nash equilibria in any given MONFG.
