# Nash Equilibria in Multi-Objective Normal-Form Games
This repository contains algorithms for retrieving Nash equilibria in Multi-Objective Normal-Form Games.

## Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria
We currently have one algorithm for finding all PSNE in a given MONFG when assuming only convex utility functions.
Due to the theorems shown in PAPER LINK, these PSNE must necessarily represent all PSNE in the MONFG under ESR, SER and in any blended setting.

## Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibria
In the future we plan on also contributing algorithms to this repo that are able to find a sample or all of the Nash equilibria in any given MONFG.
